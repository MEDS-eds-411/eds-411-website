Presentations will happen during next class. Add your slides by then.\nHow to submit: Add slides to Week 2 - Flash talks shared folder.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nPrepare four slides covering:\n\nSlide 1: A cover slide\n\nSlide 2: An ultra summarized slide covering what your project will do\nSlide 3: A brief overview of the datasets you’ll use\nSlide 4: One graph showing exploratory visualization of your data\n\nPick a person or two who are ready to do a 3 minute presentation next class\nFocus on:\n\nAvoiding big blocks of text.\nSmooth transitions between sections, clear, and precise speech.\nPractice it a bit and time it!\n\nFlash talks are the first steps in practicing for the faculty reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue when?

The “Ten simple rules…” paper will give you a good background for your team management plan (we’ll work on it next week).\n*We have reworked the DIP this year to streamline it. So, the sample DIPs from previous years do not completely match the new DIP format. However they will still give you a good idea of the information that will go into it.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue when?

Each team will present and provide feedback to other teams as follows:\n\nYour theam should work on their project outside of their “presentation block”. The following rooms are reserved for you so you have a dedicated workspace during our usual class time. You’re welcome to use other places to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminder\n\n\n\nHave you let clients, external advisors, friends or family you want to invite know when your final presentation is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen? Due on Friday, May 16 at 5 PM.\nHow? Upload to this Box folder as Word (.doc) or Google doc format, not PDF.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nAbstracts and acknowledgments will be posted to the Bren website on your individual project pages and linked to the digital event program.\n\nUpload your abstract and acknowledgments in a single file to this Box folder.\nInclude your group name in the file name.\nWord (.doc) or Google doc format preferred, not PDF (must be copy & paste-able).\n\nAbstract instructions:\n\nThe abstract is a one-paragraph brief summary of the Capstone Project, meant for a non-technical audience. The length of the abstract should be roughly 200 words. It can be the same as the one in your Technical Documentation.\nIf your project title has changed, please include the new title in the abstract.\nYour advisor must approve the final abstract and any title updates before submission.\n\nAcknowledgments instructions:\n\nThe acknowledgements should include advisors, professionals, organizations, funding sources, etc. that assisted the Capstone Project.\nEach acknowledgment should include the person’s name, title (if known), and affiliation or organization.\nYou should obtain authorization from each person or party being acknowledged that their names can be included in the abstract.\nBe consistent when listing your acknowledgments. You can list several people within an organization. Alphabetical order is preferred if listing several people in the same grouping.\n\nExample 1: Joan Dudney, Assistant Professor, Bren School\nExample 2: Bren School: Max Czapanskiy, Assistant Teaching Professor; Roland Geyer, Professor; Ruth Oliver, Assistant Professor\nExample 3: The Nature Conservancy: Kelly Easterday, Heather Gately, Moses Katkowski, Diego Ortiz, Dr. Mark Reynolds, and Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant\n\n\nTip: You can view Bren faculty titles here. Also, if you have an email from someone, you may find their title in their email signature.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen? Due by next class Wednesday, May 21.\nHow? Add slides to shared drive.\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nAssess or incorporate the feedback you received today and streamline your presentation. Iterate with your faculty advisor, TA, instructor, as needed.\nYou got this! Practice is everything!\n\nIn addition, next week you’ll practice answering questions a bit more. Questions during final presentations don’t tend to be as technical as questions during faculty reviews, but you should still be ready to answer about any details in your project.\n\nReview this presentation about best practices to answer questions. Especially the “dos” and “don’ts”\nIdentify 4 - 5 bins that you expect questions to fall into (e.g. data management, statistical analyses, working with a client). Write them down.\nBrainstorm who would be most appropriate to respond to questions in each bin.\nWrite down 2 - 3 questions in each bin that you might expect (and/or are nervous of getting) during your presentation\nPrepare, if necessary, any extra slides you might need during your Q&A.\n\nMake your best effort so that everyone in your team gets a chance to answer something. Specially the team members who are not presenting.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen? Due on Friday, May 23 at 5 PM.\nHow? Submit data’s DOI or explain why there is no data archival using this Google form.\n\n\nInstructions\n\nFriday, May 23 is the final due date to archive your capstone project data. This is an academic requirement.\nUse this week and next to:\n\nDiscuss with your advisor or client what data (if any) should be archived as part of the project deliverables.\nRead through the Archiving and Preserving Your Data information by the Library RDS team for detailed guidelines about what to archive and the submission process to Dryad.\nIf necessary, make an appointment with the RDS team (rds@library.ucsb.edu) to discuss archival of data associated with your capstone project.\n\n\nWhen you submit data to Dryad (recommended repository) the data archival process won’t be complete yet, as your submission might need to be revised. However, you will get a DOI associated with your data. To fulfill the data archival requirement, you must submit your data’s DOI by Friday, May 23. If you are not archiving any data related to your capstone project, you must briefly explain why that is the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe class will be divided in two blocks from 1:00 to 2:30 and from 2:30 to 4:00.
