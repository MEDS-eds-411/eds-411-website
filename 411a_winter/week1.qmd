## To do by next week

### 🤝 Client meeting

**Goals** for first client meeting (to be held before next class):

☑️ Clarify what the objectives are (if you have any questions - know what they are before the meeting)

☑️ Address any issue with accessing data (determine beforehand what these might be)

☑️ Find out who the audience for your product will be and if there will be people who can test it

**Before** meeting the client meeting, develop an agenda, including:

- who will be the meeting facilitator/chair and who will take notes
- agenda (with times)
- list of clarifying questions you want to ask the client
- any questions about the data - make sure you know how to access it
- PRO TIP: use the [agenda template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y9PcCfJrf8KJVcRqKVjkxQHzrDSoJx8VrmpnlpUc8Kk/edit?usp=sharing) provided during the Fall quarter.


**After** meeting: reflect with your team on how it went and what could be improved.

### 💬 Prepare a flash talk


Prepare 4 slides covering:

- Slide 1: A cover slide  
- Slide 2: An ultra summarized slide covering what your project will do
- Slide 3: A brief overview of the datasets you’ll use
- Slide 4:  One graph showing exploratory visualization of your data

Pick a person or two who are ready to do a 3 minute presentation next class
Add slides to [Week 2 - Flash talks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19YewWLJGEzCe8MM-NwbxhLlVyfyeq6SE?usp=share_link).

Focus on: 

- Avoiding big blocks of text.
- Seamless transitions between sections, clear, and precise speech.
- Practice and time it! 
- Listen for every qualifier you use. “Kind of” “sort of” “I guess.” Avoid these!

**Flash talks are the first steps in practicing for the faculty reviews.**

### 📄 Read

Read the following resources:

☑️ [MEDS Capstone Project Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qftu6sNqHeiv0p5K2xhfV8rfdc14oOk_/view?usp=share_link). 

☑️ [Sample DIPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wi1izA-w2jLl3RRhSPEC334XcFLuY653?usp=share_link)*

☑️ [Ten simple rules to cultivate belonging in collaborative data science research teams](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010567)

Come prepared with questions about the guidelines and the sample DIPs.
The “Ten simple rules…” paper will give you a good background for your team management plan (we’ll work on it next week). 

*We have reworked the DIP this year to streamline it. So, **the sample DIPs from previous years do not completely match the new DIP format**. However they will still give you a good idea of the information that will go into it.
