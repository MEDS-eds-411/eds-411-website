<details>
<summary>**Instructions**</summary>

**Goals** for first client meeting (to be held before next class):

☑️ Clarify what the objectives are (if you have any questions - know what they are before the meeting)

☑️ Address any issue with accessing data (determine beforehand what these might be)

☑️ Find out who the audience for your product will be and if there will be people who can test it

**Before** meeting the client meeting, develop an agenda, including:

- who will be the meeting facilitator/chair and who will take notes
- agenda (with times)
- list of clarifying questions you want to ask the client
- any questions about the data - make sure you know how to access it
- PRO TIP: use the [agenda template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y9PcCfJrf8KJVcRqKVjkxQHzrDSoJx8VrmpnlpUc8Kk/edit?usp=sharing) provided during the Fall quarter.

**After** meeting: reflect with your team on how it went and what could be improved.

### 📄 3. Read sample DIPs and Capstone resources and bring in questions

<details>
<summary>**Instructions**</summary>

Read the following resources:

☑️ [MEDS Capstone Project Guidelines](https://bren.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/Capstone%20Project%20Guidelines%20MEDS%202026.pdf). 

☑️ [Sample DIPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZpxTPDm0DlXn3fzkpcM3sYRfnY4gTM7I?usp=share_link)*

☑️ [Ten simple rules to cultivate belonging in collaborative data science research teams](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010567)

Come prepared with questions about the guidelines and the sample DIPs.
The “Ten simple rules…” paper will give you a good background for your team management plan (we’ll work on it next week). 

*We have reworked the DIP this year to streamline it. So, **the sample DIPs from previous years do not completely match the new DIP format**. However they will still give you a good idea of the information that will go into it.
