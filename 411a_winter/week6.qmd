## To do by next week

### üí¨ Prepare faculty review mock presentation

1. Read the [rubric for faculty reviews](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qYm7QCg1T05E8DFLZGTb2JkCVnazUEZ-5pxDRidLuuo/edit#slide=id.ge6b7f452cd_0_6982).

2. üí•Read these [guidelines for your presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rMpHTbqVPNEDBZc_o8asS2wf_RsBU7IXkBNN91qx2SA/edit?usp=sharing)üí•

3. Decide with your team what preliminary results, progress, or prototype you will include in your presentation

4. Put together a complete presentation deck following [Alex‚Äôs presentation, point 6]((https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ddl9cCrWf8AL0adNmq1y8_WEeAxIyo_RlBnUlTXPqpw/edit?usp=sharing)). It‚Äôs ok if you add stand-in figures for prototypes or preliminary results for now. Focus on the story line. 

5. Discuss your draft slides with your faculty advisor. 

6. Decide who will be presenting in faculty review (and who in public final presentation). Every person in the team should be ready to present if needed.

7. Add your draft to our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iJWmncW70KHbPyDfCPQraPg6rOcis75m?usp=share_link) and be ready to do a formal mock presentation next week!

### üìù Update DIP

If you have already received feedback from your advisor:

- discuss feedback with your team
- start working on updating your draft
- contact advisors or clients for clarification and share suggestions, and reply to comments within the document as needed. Remember to always do your research and discuss with your team first! 

## Next class schedule
