If you have already received feedback from your advisor:

- discuss feedback with your team

- ✨How will your team improve?✨
- Is your team delivering high-quality, timely work?
- Do you need to re-read the capstone guidelines?
- Should you seek more feedback or guidance from your client/advisor?
- Should you be more proactive in proposing solutions or product details?
- Does your team need to share work earlier so everyone can revise?
