## To do by next week

### Prepare faculty review mock presentation

1. Read these [guidelines for your presentation]()

2. Decide with your team what preliminary results, progress, or prototype you will include in your presentation

3. Put together a complete presentation deck following [Alexâ€™s presentation, point 6](). Itâ€™s ok if you add stand-in figures for prototypes or preliminary results for now. Focus on the story line. 

4. Discuss your draft slides with your faculty advisor. 

5. Decide who will be presenting in faculty review (and who in public final presentation). Every person in the team should be ready to present if needed.

6. Add your draft to our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B_060OmEx5nZZwuoeDGjKWrCQ3Zl95sQ?usp=share_link) and be ready to do a formal mock presentation next week!
