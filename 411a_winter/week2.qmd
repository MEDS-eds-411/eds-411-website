### 🤝 2. Submit Team Management Plan draft

**How to submit:** Add document to the [Team Management Plan draft shared folder]({{< var team-management-plan-drafts-shared-folder >}}).

- Finish drafting the DIP Team Management Plan section using the [Team Management Plan template]({{< var team-management-plan-template >}}).

Consider the following resources when writing the Team Management Plan:

- MEDS Capstone Project Guidelines
- Team’s project roles and responsibilities
- [Ten simple rules to cultivate belonging in collaborative data science research teams]({{< var ten-simple-rules-paper >}})
- Communication roles activity form last week
- [Dr. Allison Horst’s Code of Conduct](https://allisonhorst.github.io/EDS_212_essential-math/code_of_conduct.html)

Additionally, check your “Expectations between students and advisor” section in Team Management Plan with your advisor. You can add this as a discussion item to the agenda for your next meeting with your advisor or email them asking for their feedback. If you are not sure how to bring this up try something like: 

> “Our Team Management Plan must include a section about expectations between students and faculty advisor. We have included some of these expectations and would like to discuss them with you. We also want to integrate expectations you have about how our team will conduct its work in this project.”

If you have already checked these expectations with your advisor, great! You’re done.
