<span style="font-weight: bold;">Advisor Check-ins</span>

- All groups should get their advisor's feedback and approval on their project summary before submitting it this {{< var website-project-abstract-deadline >}}.

- Students might reach out about feedback on section VII of the [Team Management Plan]({{< var team-management-plan-template >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"}. This section outlines overall work expectations between team members and their faculty advisor.

- Students will start working on their Design and Implementation Plan this week. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The DIP is the primary written academic deliverable for students this term.</span> You can find all the details in the [Capstone guidelines]({{< var capstone-guidelines >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"} and read some sample DIPs from previous years [here]({{< var sample-dips >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"}. The format has been slightly updated this year, but these examples are still useful to have in mind.

- In week 5, advisors will review a complete draft of their group's DIP, but students might contact you with questions or feedback before this. 

- Students can and should keep working on data analysis and deliverables while writing their DIP!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Advisor Check-ins</span>

- Students are working on the DIP Solution Design section by creating a roadmap for their project, outlining major steps, and identifying gaps in the process. They’re also planning a timeline for completion. They might reach out to you for feedback on these sections or questions about the next steps in the project.

- <span style="font-weight: bold;">At this point, all groups should have access to the project’s data.</span>

- Students shouldn’t wait for your DIP planning to be finalized to jump into coding and exploring the data! While writing the DIP, they should be actively engaging with the data, running preliminary analyses, and coming up with questions. They know this already, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">please encourage them to divide tasks among team members to make progress on multiple fronts.</span>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">In 411A Today</span> [(slides @ website)]({{< var winter-week3-website >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"}

- We discussed how to create a diagram outlining their project’s development. These will be part of the DIP’s Solution Design and Timeline sections.

- We went over a strategy to create an elevator pitch for their project.

- The Research Data Services group from the UCSB Library met individually with each team to discuss their data management and archival needs as part of students’ preparation for writing their DIP Data Management Plan.

- Students worked independently with their capstone team and I checked in with each team for ~10 minutes.


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tasks all groups are expected to complete before next 411A class:</span>

1. Due {{< var winter-w4-class-date >}}: Draft of DIP Solution Design section, including Approach, Methods, and Research Data.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">In 411A Today</span> [(slides @ website)]({{< var winter-week4-website >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"}

- The UCSB Associate Ombuds, Dr. David Rasch, led a workshop on resolving conflict. 

- Students worked independently with their capstone team and I checked in with each team for ~5 minutes.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Advisor Check-ins</span>

- <span style="font-weight: bold;">Students will submit a complete draft of their Design and Implementation Plan (DIP) this Friday. Expect an email with a link to a Google doc on {{< var dip-draft-deadline >}}. Feedback from advisors is due on {{< var feedback-on-dip-draft-deadline >}}.</span>

- The DIP is both the primary academic deliverable this quarter and a concrete plan for how the team will address the client’s problem. A complete, high-quality draft now will provide a clear roadmap for the capstone and allow teams to focus on implementation in the coming weeks. You can see [sample past DIPs here]({{< var sample-dips >}}).


- Most teams have a strong sense of their project direction, but some need to further add details to their methods. If you are serving as a client, before {{< var dip-draft-deadline >}} is a great time to check in with your team to confirm deliverables and objectives, ensure shared expectations, and discuss detailed implementation.

- Starting next week, we’ll switch from writing the DIP to preparing for faculty review presentations. During faculty reviews, students must present preliminary results and/or a prototype. Students might contact you to discuss what will be feasible to present on {{< var faculty-reviews-date >}}.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">In 411A Today</span> [(slides @ website)]({{< var winter-week5-website >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"}

- Groups worked on the DIP Testing Plan section, discussing how their data, code, analyses, models, and data products could break and what they could do to prevent that or test their reliability.

- Alex Phillips, Asst. Teaching Professor at Bren, led a workshop about [strategies for a successful Q&A session]({{< var faculty-reviews-strategies >}}) during faculty reviews.

- Jamie Montgomery, the MEDS program director, presented the [logistics for the faculty reviews]({{< var faculty-review-logistics-slides >}}). 

- Students worked independently with their capstone team.
