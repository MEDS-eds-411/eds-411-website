### ü§ù Check Team Management Plan

Add this item to the agenda for your next meeting with your advisor or email them asking for their feedback:

**Discuss ‚ÄúExpectations between students and advisor‚Äù** in TMP
If you are not sure how to bring this up try something like: 

> ‚ÄúOur Team Management Plan must include a section about expectations between students and faculty advisor. We have included some of these expectations and would like to discuss them with you. We also want to integrate expectations you have about how our team will conduct its work in this project.‚Äù

If you have already checked these expectations with your advisor, great! You‚Äôre done.

<br>

### üí¨ Schedule 1-1 meeting

We‚Äôll have 1-1 in-person meetings February 12-16 to check how everything is going. Please [book a 10-minute slot to meet on my calendar](https://calendar.app.google/qbNAk8LHeKzRpLMq6). Meetings will take place at my office BH 4424.
