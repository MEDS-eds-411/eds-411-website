- Slide 2: Brief overview of project‚Äôs products and deliverables (don‚Äôt include academic ones) and which ones you are currently working on. 
- Slide 3: An update or two on the progress you‚Äôve made on the deliverables. Include code, graphs, or figures your team has generated. Explain how this work will integrate with or is a step towards your deliverable.

Add slides to [Week 6 - Flash talks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11tDGvX_BeqYKHwGN7c_5QxGmO2F7UFYx?usp=share_link).

- Project your voice + LOOK AT YOUR AUDIENCE (i.e. don‚Äôt read off your slides all the time)
- Ask fo questions from the audience at the end

### ü§î Discuss with team

**Context:** your Team Management Plan + DIP draft submissions + flashtalks, and the feedback you received.

**Add this item to the agenda for your next team meeting:**

Discuss what went well and and what could be better:

- ‚ú®How will your team improve?‚ú®
- Is your team delivering high-quality, timely work?
- Do you need to re-read the capstone guidelines?
- Should you seek more feedback or guidance from your client/advisor?
- Should you be more proactive in proposing solutions or product details?
- Does your team need to share work earlier so everyone can revise?
- Do you need to establish new expectations or ground rules in your team management plan?
