### No need to "Send repository access to CP coordinator"

The previous deadlines outline contained an out-of-date instruction about "Sending repository access to CP coordinator." You donâ€™t need to do anything! We needed it last year, but this year I have the URLs to all your GitHub orgs where you have your project's code. 

Thanks to the groups who brought this to my attention!
