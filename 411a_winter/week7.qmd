## To do by next week

### üí¨ Prepare mock presentation 2.0

- I might send you some extra comments and feedback
- Incorporate the feedback and streamline your presentation
- Iterate with your faculty advisor
- Practice makes perfect!

Add your slides to [this shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gf0zctr2LxVwx382vJ4e9PPcdBHLQEuj?usp=share_link) before class.

Be sure to review the following resources when preparing your presentation:

### ü§î Prepare for Q&A

Next week, we‚Äôll practice answering questions a bit more. 

1. **Review** this [presentation about best practices to answer questions about your presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1idCPdoY0y-rUTiGJMcERiEhA56iiUypECBBV6_MJ-sM/edit?usp=sharing).

2. **Identify** 4 - 5 bins that you expect faculty review questions to fall into (e.g. model selection, data management, statistical analyses). Write them down.

3. **Decide** who would be most appropriate to respond to questions in each bin.

4. **Write** down 2 - 3 questions in each bin that you might expect (and/or are afraid of getting) during your faculty review

5. **Prepare**, if necessary, any extra slides you might need during your Q&A

<br>

### üìù Keep working on...

- Updating your DIP. *I might provide some feedback by the end of this week.* 

- Getting your **preliminary results or creating a prototype for review**
