    - Your ABT slide should look like the in-class examples: include "and", "but", "therefore"

- Make sure font is not too small.
- Practice it a bit and time it.
- Listen for every qualifier you use. “Kind of” “sort of” “I guess.” Try to avoid these!
- When describing your workflow diagram, practice curious statements. Instead of “We have no idea how we’re going to do this part,” what can you say? 
- Project your voice!
- Ask for questions at the end of the presentation
