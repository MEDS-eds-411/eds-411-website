<span style="font-weight: bold;">Advisor Check-ins</span>

- All groups should get their advisor's feedback and approval on their project summary before submitting it this {{< var website-project-abstract-deadline >}}.

- Students might reach out about feedback on section VII of the [Team Management Plan]({{< var team-management-plan-template >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"}. This section outlines overall work expectations between team members and their faculty advisor.

- Students will start working on their Design and Implementation Plan this week. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The DIP is the primary written academic deliverable for students this term.</span> You can find all the details in the [Capstone guidelines]({{< var capstone-guidelines >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"} and read some sample DIPs from previous years [here]({{< var sample-dips >}}){style="color: #0066cc;"}. The format has been slightly updated this year, but these examples are still useful to have in mind.

- In week 5, advisors will review a complete draft of their group's DIP, but students might contact you with questions or feedback before this. 

- Students can and should keep working on data analysis and deliverables while writing their DIP!
