Friday, May 23 is the final due date to archive your capstone project data. This is an academic requirement. 

Use this week and next to:

1. Discuss with your advisor or client what data (if any) should be archived as part of the project deliverables.
2. Read through the [Archiving and Preserving Your Data](https://ucsb-library-research-data-services.github.io/project-data-management/preserve.html) information by the Library RDS team for detailed guidelines about what to archive and the submission process to Dryad. 
3. If necessary, make an appointment with the RDS team (rds@library.ucsb.edu) to discuss archival of data associated with your capstone project. 
4. 

When you submit data to Dryad (recommended repository) the data archival process wonâ€™t be complete yet, as your submission might need to be revised. However, you will get a DOI associated with your data. **To fulfill the data archival requirement, you must [submit your dataâ€™s DOI](https://forms.gle/yGoKVjNgUR69D3XP9) by Friday, May 23. If you are not archiving any data related to your capstone project, you must briefly explain why that is the case.**
