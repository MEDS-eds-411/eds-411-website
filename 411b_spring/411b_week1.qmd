## To do by next week

### 📝 Submit Technical Documentation Sections Outline

**Submit by next class (1 PM on Wednesday 4/9).**

Create a single Google doc with the following information:

1. Information for your executive summary about background, motivation, problem statement, objectives, and deliverables. Have each of these as a separate section for this draft 

2. A **detailed list of the sections** (outline) your team will have in their Technical Documentation.
    - Specify who is the audience for each section or group of sections.
    - *Discuss this with your advisor.*

2. A **timeline to completion** for your Technical Documentation taking into account the capstone deadlines. Consider making a Gantt chart, but also a list of dates and deliverables is ok.
    Tips:
    - If you liked how we split up the DIP by sections per week, try implementing something similar.
    - Write your executive summary and abstract last, your project might evolve along the quarter.


- It’s ok to use your DIP as a starting point. Here’s some  [examples for this assignment](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wsSO4-tMG97xGonh0R8lSnqEYXWB-x43?usp=share_link) for reference.

- Add your document to our [shared folder TD Outlines and Timeline](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wFdkjj4wb6Y-SDn7wiBOrRpD8K_3VF7P?usp=share_link). 


### 🗓️ Revise your project timeline

- Revise the timeline you submitted in your DIP: are you on time to complete it? 
- Revise and discuss your updated timeline with your advisor. 
- Update your client on any significant changes.
