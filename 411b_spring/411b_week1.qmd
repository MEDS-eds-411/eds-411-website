## To do by next week

### 📝 1. Draft Technical Documentation outline and timeline

**Due when?** Before next class {{< var spring-week1-class >}}, we will use this document for an in-class activity.

**How to submit:** Add your document to our [shared folder TD Outlines and Timeline]({{< var td-outlines-and-timeline >}}).

<details>
<summary>**Instructions**</summary>

Create a single Google documet with the following:

1. Information for your executive summary about (1) background, (2) motivation, (3) problem statement, (4) objectives, and (5) deliverables. Have each of these as a separate section for this draft.

2. A **detailed list of the sections** (outline or table of contents) your team will have in their Technical Documentation.
    - Specify who is the audience for each section or group of sections.
    - *Discuss this with your advisor.*

2. A **timeline to completion** for your Technical Documentation taking into account the capstone deadlines. Consider making a Gantt chart, but also a list of dates and deliverables is ok.
    Tips:
    - If you liked how we split up the DIP by sections per week, try implementing something similar.
    - Write your executive summary and abstract last, your project might evolve along the quarter.
    - It’s ok to use your DIP as a starting point.

<details>
<summary>**Instructions**</summary>
