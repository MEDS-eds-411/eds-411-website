### 🎤 Prepare mock presentation and Q&A 
**When? Due by next class Wednesday, May 21.**

**How? Add slides to [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13w2pizodM_M5w1MwDHjmZUn_5hm0M_Hu?usp=share_link).**

<details>
<summary>**Instructions**</summary>

- Assess or incorporate the feedback you received today and streamline your presentation. Iterate with your faculty advisor, TA, instructor, as needed. 
- You got this! Practice is everything!

In addition, next week you’ll practice answering questions a bit more. Questions during final presentations don’t tend to be as technical as questions during faculty reviews, but you should still be ready to answer about any details in your project.

- **Review** this [presentation about best practices to answer questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1idCPdoY0y-rUTiGJMcERiEhA56iiUypECBBV6_MJ-sM/edit?usp=sharing). Especially the “dos” and “don'ts”
- **Identify** 4 - 5 bins that you expect questions to fall into (e.g. data management, statistical analyses, working with a client). Write them down.
- **Brainstorm** who would be most appropriate to respond to questions in each bin.
- **Write down** 2 - 3 questions in each bin that you might expect (and/or are nervous of getting) during your presentation
- **Prepare**, if necessary, any extra slides you might need during your Q&A.

Make your best effort so that everyone in your team gets a chance to answer something.  Specially the team members who are not presenting.

### 📊 Complete data archival 

**When? Due on Friday, May 23 at 5 PM.**

**How? Submit data's DOI or explain why there is no data archival using [this Google form](https://forms.gle/yGoKVjNgUR69D3XP9).**

<details>
<summary>**Instructions**</summary>
Friday, May 23 is the final due date to archive your capstone project data. This is an academic requirement. 

Use this week and next to:

1. Discuss with your advisor or client what data (if any) should be archived as part of the project deliverables.
2. Read through the [Archiving and Preserving Your Data](https://ucsb-library-research-data-services.github.io/project-data-management/preserve.html) information by the Library RDS team for detailed guidelines about what to archive and the submission process to Dryad. 
3. If necessary, make an appointment with the RDS team (rds@library.ucsb.edu) to discuss archival of data associated with your capstone project. 
4. 

When you submit data to Dryad (recommended repository) the data archival process won’t be complete yet, as your submission might need to be revised. However, you will get a DOI associated with your data. **To fulfill the data archival requirement, you must [submit your data’s DOI](https://forms.gle/yGoKVjNgUR69D3XP9) by Friday, May 23. If you are not archiving any data related to your capstone project, you must briefly explain why that is the case.**
